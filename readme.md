## Known Bugs

_Occasionally the API returns a 429 (Too Many Requests) response. This is likely due to the nature of the BetterDoctor API and not a bug in the program, but if you believe it is, please [message](mailto:darth.toad@gmail.com) me. Also, I'm having trouble getting error messages to show._
